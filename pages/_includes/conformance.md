## US-Core Conformance Requirements

This section outlines conformance requirements for each of the US-Core actors identifying the specific profiles that need to be supported, the specific RESTful operations that need to be supported, and the search parameters that need to be supported. Note: The individual US-Core profiles identify the structural constraints, terminology bindings and invariants, however, implementers must refer to the conformance requirements for details on the RESTful operations, specific profiles and the search parameters applicable to each of the US-Core actors.

* [Conformance requirements for the US-Core Server] (Responder Actor) which is responsible for providing responses to the queries submitted by the US-Core Requestors.
